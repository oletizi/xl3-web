## Development Guidelines

### Core Principles
- **Module Isolation**: Each module should be self-contained with clear boundaries
- **Shared Resource Optimization**: Common utilities and types in shared packages to avoid duplication
- **Break backwards compatibility by default** and eliminate fallbacks unless explicitly required
- **NEVER create duplicate files during refactoring** - always refactor existing files in place
- **Use TypeScript for all new modules** with strict configuration
- **Follow existing configuration patterns** and maintain consistency
- **Keep security-first mindset** throughout development
- **ALWAYS VERIFY FILE OPERATIONS** - Never assume files were written without explicit verification

### ⚠️ CRITICAL: File Operation Verification Protocol

**MANDATORY for ALL agents**: Every file operation MUST be verified before claiming completion.

#### Required Verification Steps:
1. **After Writing Files**: Use `ls` or `cat` to verify file exists and contains expected content
2. **After Editing Files**: Use `cat` or `head`/`tail` to confirm changes were applied
3. **After Creating Directories**: Use `ls -la` to verify directory structure
4. **Before Reporting Completion**: Provide evidence that files actually exist on disk

#### Example Verification Pattern:
```bash
# ❌ WRONG - Don't just write and assume it worked
Write file.ts
"Task complete!"

# ✅ CORRECT - Always verify
Write file.ts
ls -la file.ts                    # Verify file exists
head -10 file.ts                  # Verify content is correct
"Task complete - file verified at [path] with [X] lines"
```

#### Verification Requirements by Operation:
- **New Files**: `ls -la [path]` + `wc -l [path]` + brief content sample
- **Edited Files**: `diff` or `cat` snippet showing the change was applied
- **Directory Creation**: `ls -la [parent]` showing new directory
- **Multiple Files**: Verify each file individually, provide file count summary

### TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict mode with all safety flags enabled
- **FOLLOW interface-first design patterns** for modular architecture
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` with proper guards
- Always use interfaces and factories, never concrete class dependencies
- Implement proper error handling with descriptive messages
- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing appropriately

### Monorepo Management
- Keep modules independent with clear boundaries
- Share common types through dedicated packages
- Use workspace protocol for internal dependencies
- Maintain consistent versioning across modules

### MIDI/Audio Specific
- Follow MIDI specification standards
- Support both 7-bit and 14-bit CC values
- Handle NRPN/RPN parameters correctly
- Consider real-time performance constraints
- Support various DAW-specific quirks

### API Design Principles
- Fluent, chainable interfaces for builders
- Clear separation between input validation and processing
- Comprehensive but not overwhelming configuration options
- Sensible defaults with override capability
- Type-safe throughout the entire API surface

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New MIDI Mapping Type
1. Define TypeScript interfaces in types/
2. Create Zod validation schema
3. Implement parser/serializer
4. Add builder methods
5. Write comprehensive tests
6. Document with examples

### Creating a New Module
1. Create module directory under modules/
2. Set up package.json with proper naming
3. Configure TypeScript with base config
4. Implement core functionality
5. Add to workspace references
6. Write README with examples

### Implementing DAW Support
1. Research DAW's MIDI format
2. Create format-specific types
3. Build converter from canonical format
4. Test with real DAW
5. Document limitations/quirks

## Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for all public functions
- Integration tests for module interactions
- Validation tests for all schemas
- Performance tests for parsing/serialization
- Example-based tests from documentation

## Documentation Standards

- Every public API must have JSDoc comments

- Validation: < 5ms for standard maps
- Serialization: < 20ms for complex maps
- Memory: < 50MB for 1000 mappings
- Real-time operations: < 1ms latency

## Active Development Focus

3. Implementing additional DAW converters
4. Optimizing performance for large configurations
5. Building CLI tools for map management

## Quality Gates

### ⚠️ MANDATORY File Verification Gates
Before ANY agent can claim task completion:
- [ ] **File Existence Verified**: All claimed file operations verified with `ls`/`cat`/`head`
- [ ] **Content Verification**: File contents match specifications (show evidence)
- [ ] **Directory Structure**: New directories verified with `ls -la`
- [ ] **File Count Confirmation**: Expected number of files created/modified

### Standard Quality Gates
Before committing changes, ensure:
- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
- [ ] Code review approval for significant changes
- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 10ms parsing, < 1ms real-time)
- [ ] **ALL FILE OPERATIONS VERIFIED** (evidence provided)

## Agent-Specific Guidelines

### 🚨 UNIVERSAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ALL AGENTS
**ALL AGENTS MUST**:
1. **After any file operation, verify with bash commands and provide evidence**
2. **NEVER create duplicate files during refactoring** (no file-new.ts, file-v2.ts, etc.)
3. **Always refactor existing files in place**
4. **Break backward compatibility by default unless explicitly told otherwise**
