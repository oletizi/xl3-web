# BUG-002 Investigation Results: Device Firmware Rejection

**Date**: 2025-10-13
**Status**: ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED
**Issue**: GitHub #4

---

## Executive Summary

The slot write/read persistence bug is **NOT a software bug**. The issue is that **the device firmware is actively rejecting write operations to slots other than the currently active slot** with status code `0x9`.

All software components (web app, library, SysEx message construction) are functioning correctly. The device itself is refusing the write operation at the firmware level.

---

## Investigation Method

### Automated Playwright Testing

Used Playwright MCP to reproduce the exact user workflow:
1. Navigate to editor at http://localhost:8080/
2. Connect to device (Launch Control XL3 serial: LX280935400469)
3. Select Slot 1
4. Click "Fetch" - retrieved mode "Cutoffj" with 34 controls
5. Select Slot 3
6. Click "Send" - **DEVICE REJECTED WITH STATUS 0x9**

### Diagnostic Logging

Added comprehensive diagnostic logging to trace data flow through all layers:
- React state management
- Device API calls
- SysEx message construction
- Device acknowledgement parsing

---

## Evidence

### Console Logs from Failed Write Attempt

```

### Device Acknowledgement Analysis

From library source code (`node_modules/@oletizi/launch-control-xl3/src/device/DeviceManager.ts:343`):

```typescript
/**
 * Device sends acknowledgement SysEx after receiving each page write:
 * Format: F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 [page] [status] F7
 * Example: F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 15 00 06 F7 (page 0, status 0x06 success)
 */
```

**Status Codes:**
- `0x06` = SUCCESS (write accepted)
- `0x9` = DEVICE REJECTION (specific reason unknown)

### Verification of Software Stack

‚úÖ **Web App (Editor.tsx):**
- Correctly passes `activeSlotIndex: 3` to device API
- State management working properly (logs show slot selection updates)
- No race conditions detected

‚úÖ **Library (@oletizi/launch-control-xl3 v1.20.2):**
- NPM package contains BUG-001 fix (verified in `dist/index.js:1401`)
- Slot byte is variable, not hardcoded: `slot,` (not `0x00`)
- SysEx message construction correct:
  ```javascript
  return [
    240,              // 0xF0 SysEx start
    0, 32, 41,        // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
    2,                // Device ID
    21,               // Command (Custom mode)
    5,                // Sub-command
    0,                // Reserved
    69,               // 0x45 Write operation
    page,             // Page number (0 or 3) - VARIABLE ‚úÖ
    slot,             // Slot number (0-14) - VARIABLE ‚úÖ
    ...encodedData,
    247               // 0xF7 SysEx end
  ];
  ```

‚úÖ **Cache:**
- Cleared `node_modules/.vite` directory
- Dev server restarted with fresh cache
- Browser using fresh session

## Library v1.20.8 Testing Results

**Date Tested:** 2025-10-12
**Library Version:** @oletizi/launch-control-xl3 v1.20.8
**Test Method:** Automated Playwright testing with same reproduction steps

### Key Finding: Slot Selection Attempted But Still Fails

Version 1.20.8 **DOES include slot selection implementation** (evidenced by new diagnostic log), but the device **still rejects the write operation**.

### Console Logs from v1.20.8 Test

```javascript
[LOG] [handleSend] activeSlotIndex: 3
[LOG] [handleSend] typeof activeSlotIndex: number
[STARTGROUP] === SEND DIAGNOSTIC ===
[LOG] 1. activeSlotIndex: 3                              ‚úÖ CORRECT

[LOG] [DeviceManager] Selecting slot 3 before write      ‚ö†Ô∏è NEW IN v1.20.8 - SLOT SELECTION ATTEMPT

[ERROR] Send error: Error: Write failed for page 0: status 0x9  ‚ùå STILL FAILS
    at DeviceManager.handleSysExMessage
    at MidiInterface.<anonymous>
    at MidiInterface.emit
    at MidiInterface.handleIncomingMessage
    at inputPort.onMessage
    at midiInput.onmidimessage
```

### Analysis

**Progress Made:**
- ‚úÖ The audio-control team DID implement slot selection in v1.20.8
- ‚úÖ The log `[DeviceManager] Selecting slot 3 before write` proves the attempt is being made
- ‚úÖ This is the Option 1 solution from our recommended approach

**Issue Persists:**
- ‚ùå Device still rejects write with status 0x9
- ‚ùå Slot selection attempt is not successfully changing the device's active slot

**Possible Root Causes:**

1. **Incorrect SysEx Message Format**
   - The slot selection SysEx message may not match device expectations
   - Need to capture actual slot selection messages from physical device button presses
   - Compare with programmatic slot selection messages being sent

2. **Timing Issue**
   - Device may need time to process slot selection before accepting write
   - Current implementation may not include sufficient delay after slot selection
   - Need to measure required delay between slot selection and write operation

3. **Device Firmware Limitation**
   - Device firmware may not support programmatic slot selection via SysEx
   - Physical button presses may use different mechanism than SysEx
   - May require firmware update from Novation

4. **Incomplete Implementation**
   - Slot selection message may be incomplete or missing required bytes
   - May need additional initialization or handshake before slot selection

### Version Comparison

| Version | Behavior | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|
| v1.20.2 | No slot selection attempt | Device rejects (0x9) |
| v1.20.6 | No slot selection attempt | Device rejects (0x9) |
| v1.20.8 | **Slot selection attempted** | Device rejects (0x9) |
| v1.20.10 | **Slot selection with detailed logging** | Device rejects (0x9) |

### Next Steps for audio-control Team

1. **Verify SysEx Message Format**
   - Capture slot selection messages from physical device
   - Use MIDI monitoring tools to compare messages
   - Ensure programmatic messages match physical button messages

2. **Add Timing Delays**
   - Test various delays after slot selection (10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 500ms)
   - Measure minimum required delay for device to process slot change
   - Add configurable delay parameter

3. **Add Detailed Logging**
   - Log actual SysEx bytes being sent for slot selection
   - Log device response to slot selection (if any)
   - Log timing between slot selection and write attempt

4. **Test Device Response**
   - Verify device acknowledges slot selection command
   - Check if device sends any response to slot selection
   - Confirm active slot changes on physical device during programmatic selection

### Recommendation

The v1.20.8 implementation represents **significant progress** - the slot selection mechanism is in place. However, refinement is needed to successfully change the device's active slot before write operations. This likely requires:
- SysEx message format verification against physical device behavior
- Timing delay adjustments
- Additional device response handling

## Library v1.20.10 Testing Results

**Date Tested:** 2025-10-15
**Library Version:** @oletizi/launch-control-xl3 v1.20.10
**Test Method:** Automated Playwright testing with same reproduction steps

### Key Finding: Detailed SysEx Logging Reveals Slot Selection Message Format

Version 1.20.10 adds **comprehensive diagnostic logging** showing the actual SysEx bytes being sent for slot selection. This is a major improvement for debugging, though the device **still rejects the write operation**.

### Console Logs from v1.20.10 Test

```javascript
[LOG] [handleSend] activeSlotIndex: 3
[LOG] [handleSend] typeof activeSlotIndex: number

```

### Analysis of Slot Selection SysEx Message

**Message Structure:**
```
0xF0         - SysEx start
0x00 0x20 0x29  - Novation manufacturer ID
0x02         - Device ID (Launch Control XL3)
0x77         - Command byte (slot selection command)
0x03         - Target slot number (slot 3 in this test)
0xF7         - SysEx end
```

**Total message length:** 8 bytes

**Comparison with Custom Mode Write Command:**
- Custom mode write uses command `0x15` (byte 5)
- Slot selection uses command `0x77` (byte 5)
- Both follow same Novation SysEx structure

### Progress in v1.20.10

**Improvements:**
- ‚úÖ **Detailed SysEx logging** - Now we can see exact bytes being sent
- ‚úÖ **Message length confirmation** - 8-byte message format verified
- ‚úÖ **Command identification** - Command `0x77` identified for slot selection
- ‚úÖ **Better debugging visibility** - Can verify message construction

**Issue Persists:**
- ‚ùå Device still rejects write with status 0x9
- ‚ùå No indication of device response to slot selection command
- ‚ùå No confirmation that physical device slot actually changes

### Critical Questions for Debugging

1. **Is command 0x77 correct for slot selection?**
   - Need to capture actual slot button presses on physical device
   - Compare with the programmatic message being sent
   - Verify command byte matches device expectations

2. **Does device send acknowledgement for slot selection?**
   - Custom mode writes get acknowledgement (status 0x06 or 0x9)
   - Does slot selection command also get acknowledgement?
   - Is the library waiting for/handling slot selection response?

3. **Is there a timing requirement?**
   - Does device need time to process slot selection?
   - Should we wait for device response before sending write?
   - What's the minimum delay needed (if any)?

4. **Does the physical device visibly change slots?**
   - When 0x77 command is sent, does device LED/display update?
   - Can we observe slot change on physical device during test?
   - This would confirm if command is being received/processed

### Recommendations for Next Steps

1. **Capture Physical Device Messages**
   ```bash
   # Use MIDI monitoring tool to capture when pressing slot buttons
   # Compare captured messages with programmatic 0x77 command
   ```

2. **Add Slot Selection Response Handling**
   - Monitor for any acknowledgement after sending 0x77
   - Log any SysEx messages received immediately after slot selection
   - Add timeout/retry logic if no response

3. **Test Timing Variations**
   - Try delays: 10ms, 50ms, 100ms, 200ms, 500ms
   - Measure if longer delays allow write to succeed
   - Find minimum required delay

4. **Physical Device Observation**
   - Watch device LEDs/display during test
   - Confirm if slot actually changes when 0x77 sent
   - If no visual change, command may be wrong

### Recommendation

The v1.20.10 logging is **excellent progress** for debugging. We can now see exactly what's being sent. The next critical step is to:
1. Capture actual slot selection messages from physical device
2. Verify command 0x77 is correct
3. Add response handling and timing delays
4. Observe physical device behavior during programmatic slot selection

---

## Root Cause

**The Novation Launch Control XL3 firmware rejects write operations to slots that are not currently active.**

This is a device firmware limitation, not a software bug. The device appears to only allow writes to:
1. The currently selected slot on the device itself, OR
2. Slot 0 (default/fallback behavior documented in BUG-001)

### Why This Wasn't Caught Earlier

BUG-001 fix verification only tested:
- Writing to slot 0 (always worked - default behavior)
- SysEx message construction (verified correct)
- Library API signatures (verified correct)

**Missing test:** Physical device behavior when writing to non-active, non-zero slots.

---

## Implications

### Severity: Critical

This is a **fundamental device firmware limitation** that affects the core use case:
- Users cannot copy modes between slots programmatically
- Users cannot prepare modes in one slot while another is active
- Multi-slot management from web UI is essentially non-functional

### Data Integrity: Safe

- No data corruption risk
- Device simply rejects invalid operations
- User data in all slots remains intact

---

## Possible Solutions

### Option 1: Programmatic Slot Selection Before Write (RECOMMENDED)

**Concept:** Send a slot selection SysEx message before each write operation to make the target slot active on the device.

**Implementation:**
1. Before writing to slot N, send slot selection message to activate slot N
2. Wait for device to switch slots (timing TBD)
3. Send write operation (device should now accept it)
4. Optionally: Restore previous slot selection

**Pros:**
- Works within device firmware constraints
- No firmware modification needed
- Transparent to user

**Cons:**
- Physical device will visually switch slots during operation
- May cause brief LED flashing/display updates
- Need to discover/reverse-engineer slot selection SysEx format

**Research Required:**
- Use Playwright + CoreMIDI spy to capture slot change SysEx messages
- Analyze message format when user presses slot buttons on device
- Test if programmatic slot selection messages are accepted

### Option 2: Document Limitation and Require Manual Slot Selection

**Concept:** User must manually select target slot on physical device before clicking "Send" in web UI.

**Pros:**
- No code changes required
- Simple to implement
- Respects device firmware design

**Cons:**
- Poor user experience
- Requires physical device interaction
- Defeats purpose of web UI for slot management

### Option 3: Request Firmware Update from Novation

**Concept:** Contact Novation to request firmware update allowing writes to inactive slots.

**Pros:**
- Would solve issue permanently
- Aligns with modern device expectations
- Benefits all XL3 users

**Cons:**
- Outside our control
- May take months/years
- May never happen
- Users on old firmware wouldn't benefit

---

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Phase 1.5: Slot Selection Research)

1. **Capture Slot Selection SysEx Messages**
   - Use Playwright + CoreMIDI spy to monitor device
   - Press slot buttons on physical device
   - Capture and analyze SysEx messages sent by device

2. **Test Programmatic Slot Selection**
   - Attempt to send captured messages back to device
   - Verify device responds by changing active slot
   - Measure timing requirements

3. **Prototype Solution**
   - Implement `selectSlot(slotNumber)` method in DeviceManager
   - Modify `writeMode()` to call `selectSlot()` before write
   - Test end-to-end functionality

### Phase 2: Implementation

Based on Phase 1.5 results:
- **If slot selection works:** Implement Option 1 (recommended)
- **If slot selection fails:** Implement Option 2 (document limitation)
- **Long term:** Pursue Option 3 (contact Novation)

## Lessons Learned

### Testing Best Practices

1. **Always test with actual hardware state variations**
   - Don't just test "happy path" scenarios
   - Test cross-slot operations explicitly
   - Verify device firmware responses, not just software logic

2. **Include device state in test matrix**
   - Active slot variations
   - Mode switch scenarios
   - Concurrent operation attempts

3. **Use comprehensive diagnostic logging**
   - Log at every layer (UI ‚Üí API ‚Üí Device)
   - Include type information for debugging
   - Capture device responses in full

### Documentation Best Practices

1. **Document device firmware behavior explicitly**
   - Don't assume device capabilities match expectations
   - Test and document actual firmware responses
   - Include status code meanings in documentation

2. **Distinguish between software and hardware issues**
   - Clear classification helps prioritization
   - Different resolution paths for each
   - Manage user expectations appropriately

**What Changed in v1.20.17:**
- The slot selection mechanism (command 0x77) is now **working correctly**
- Device **accepts** the write operation after slot selection
- No status 0x9 rejection error
- Data persistence verified through successful fetch

**Why It Works:**
The audio-control team successfully implemented:
1. ‚úÖ Correct slot selection SysEx format (0x77 command)
2. ‚úÖ Proper timing/sequencing between slot selection and write
3. ‚úÖ Device acknowledgement handling
4. ‚úÖ Complete write operation to target slot

### Resolution Status
