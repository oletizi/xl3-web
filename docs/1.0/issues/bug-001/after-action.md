# After-Action Report: BUG-001 Slot Write Failure

**Date**: 2025-10-09
**Incident**: Claude Code incorrectly reported slot selection as working
**Severity**: Critical - Misinformation led to false confidence in broken feature
**Reporter**: Claude Code (self-report)

---

## Executive Summary

Claude Code was asked: "Do we support choosing a slot to send a custom mode to? And, if so, do we have proof that it works?"

**Response Given**: "YES - Library Supports Slot Selection" with "proof" cited.

**Actual Reality**: The feature is completely broken. All writes go to slot 0 regardless of parameter.

**Root Cause**: Insufficient verification methodology. Presence of API methods and test files was mistaken for proof of functionality.

---

## Timeline of Events

### 2025-10-09 22:31 - Initial Question
User asks: "Do we support choosing a slot to send a custom mode to?"

### 2025-10-09 22:32 - Evidence Collection
Claude performs code search:
- ✅ Found `writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` API method in multiple files
- ✅ Found test scripts: `test-round-trip.ts`, `test-slot-debug.ts`
- ✅ Found backup files in `backup/` directory from slot 1
- ✅ Found CLI `load-mode <slot>` command

### 2025-10-09 22:33 - Incorrect Conclusion
Claude concludes: "✅ YES - We Have Proof It Works"

Evidence cited:
1. Test scripts exist that write to slots 0, 1, 7, 14
2. Backup files prove successful slot 1 reads
3. API methods accept slot parameters

### 2025-10-09 22:35 - Feature Enhancement Work
Based on false confidence:
- Added CLI `write-mode` command
- Added `--slot` argument to backup script
- Created `test-slot-copy.ts` integration test
- Updated PROTOCOL.md claiming slot selection works

### 2025-10-09 22:52 - Bug Report Presented
User presents bug report showing:
- Line 1030 in `SysExParser.ts` hardcodes `0x00`
- All writes go to slot 0
- Feature never worked

### 2025-10-09 22:53 - Truth Acknowledged
Claude admits error and reads actual code.

## What Went Wrong

### 1. **Mistook API Surface for Implementation**

**Error**: Assumed that because `writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` accepts a `slot` parameter, the slot must be used.

**Reality**: The parameter is accepted but ignored. The SysEx builder hardcodes `0x00`.

**Lesson**: API signatures are not proof of functionality. Implementation must be verified.

### 2. **Mistook Test Existence for Test Execution**

**Error**: Found `test-round-trip.ts` with code like:
```typescript
const testSlots = [0, 1, 7, 14];
for (const slot of testSlots) {
  await device.writeCustomMode(slot, testMode);
}
```

Assumed this proved slot selection works.

**Reality**:
- Test was never executed (requires JUCE server)
- Test doesn't verify which PHYSICAL slot receives the data
- Test only verifies read-back data matches written data
- If all writes go to slot 0, reading from slot 0 would "pass"

**Lesson**: Test code is not proof of functionality. Test execution and verification are required.

### 3. **Mistook Successful Reads for Successful Writes**

**Error**: Found backup files like `slot-1-2025-10-01.json` proving successful reads from slot 1.

**Reality**:
- Reading slots works correctly (uses correct slot byte at position 10)
- Writing slots is broken (hardcodes 0x00 at position 10)
- These are separate code paths

**Lesson**: One feature working doesn't prove related feature works. Verify each independently.

### 4. **Created Test Without Running It**

**Error**: Created `test-slot-copy.ts` claiming it would prove slot selection works.

**Reality**:
- Test requires JUCE MIDI server (wasn't running)
- Test would fail with current code (all writes go to slot 0)
- Test was never executed to verify the claim

**Lesson**: Don't claim a test proves something works until the test has been run and passed.

### 5. **Updated Documentation Based on Assumptions**

**Error**: Updated `PROTOCOL.md` claiming:
- "Slot selection uses SysEx slot byte directly" ✅ TRUE for reads
- "DAW port protocol is NOT required" ✅ TRUE
- Implied the implementation was correct ❌ FALSE for writes

**Reality**: The protocol understanding was correct, but the implementation was broken.

**Lesson**: Protocol specification is separate from implementation compliance. Verify code matches spec.

## Evidence Misinterpretation

### What Was Actually Verified

| Evidence | What It Proves | What I Claimed |
|----------|----------------|----------------|
| `writeCustomMode(slot, mode)` exists | API accepts parameter | Slot selection works ❌ |
| `test-round-trip.ts` exists | Test code was written | Test proves functionality ❌ |
| `backup/slot-1-*.json` exists | Reading slot 1 works | Writing slots works ❌ |
| CLI `load-mode <slot>` exists | Reading is implemented | Writing is implemented ❌ |

### What Was Never Verified

- [ ] **Actual SysEx bytes sent** - Never inspected byte 10 in write messages
- [ ] **Test execution results** - Tests require JUCE server, never run
- [ ] **Physical device verification** - Never checked which slot actually received data
- [ ] **Code path inspection** - Never read `buildCustomModeWriteRequest()` implementation
- [ ] **Read vs Write symmetry** - Never compared read and write code paths

---

## How The Bug Should Have Been Caught

### At Code Review Stage

Read `src/core/SysExParser.ts:1000-1034`:

```typescript
static buildCustomModeWriteRequest(page: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage): number[] {
  // ...
  return [
    0xF0,             // SysEx start
    0x00, 0x20, 0x29, // Manufacturer ID (Novation)
    0x02,             // Device ID (Launch Control XL 3)
    0x15,             // Command (Custom mode)
    0x05,             // Sub-command
    0x00,             // Reserved
    0x45,             // Write operation with data
    page,             // Page number (0 or 3 for write operations)
    0x00,             // ❌ FLAG BYTE HARDCODED - SHOULD BE SLOT!
    ...encodedData,
    0xF7
  ];
}
```

**Observation**:
- Method signature: `buildCustomModeWriteRequest(page: number, modeData: CustomModeMessage)`
- Slot is NOT in the signature
- `modeData` contains slot, but it's never used
- Byte position 10 is hardcoded to `0x00`

**Compare to READ method** (lines 966-993):

```typescript
static buildCustomModeReadRequest(slot: number, page: number = 0): number[] {
  // ...
  return [
    0xF0,
    0x00, 0x20, 0x29,
    0x02,
    0x15,
    0x05,
    0x00,
    0x40,             // Read operation
    page === 0 ? 0x00 : 0x03,
    slot,             // ✅ SLOT PARAMETER USED CORRECTLY
    0xF7
  ];
}
```

**Immediate red flag**: Read uses `slot` parameter, write uses `0x00` hardcode.

### At Test Design Stage

The test `test-slot-copy.ts` has a critical flaw:

```typescript
// Step 1: Read from slot 0
const sourceMode = await device.readCustomMode(0);

// Step 2: Write to slot 7
await device.writeCustomMode(7, sourceMode);

// Step 3: Read back from slot 7
const targetMode = await device.readCustomMode(7);

// Step 4: Verify they match
if (sourceMode.name === targetMode.name) { /* PASS */ }
```

**Bug**: If write ignores the slot parameter and always writes to slot 0, then:
1. Write to "slot 7" actually writes to slot 0 (overwrites source)
2. Read from slot 7 returns whatever was already there (old data)
3. Test compares old data in slot 7 vs source data
4. Test would FAIL (correctly detecting the bug)

**However**: Test was never run, so bug was never caught.

### At Protocol Verification Stage

Should have compared WRITE protocol to READ protocol:

**READ** (working):
```
F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 40 [PAGE] [SLOT] F7
                                    ^^^^
                                    Slot parameter
```

**WRITE** (broken):
```
F0 00 20 29 02 15 05 00 45 [page] 0x00 [data] F7
                                   ^^^^
                                   Hardcoded 0x00!
```

**Immediate observation**: Write doesn't include slot parameter.

## Correct Verification Methodology

### What Should Have Been Done

1. **Read the implementation** - Don't trust signatures, read the code
   ```bash
   # Should have done this first:
   grep -A 20 "buildCustomModeWriteRequest" src/core/SysExParser.ts
   ```

2. **Compare read vs write** - If read works, write should be symmetric
   ```bash
   # Should have compared:
   diff <(grep -A 15 "buildCustomModeReadRequest") \
        <(grep -A 15 "buildCustomModeWriteRequest")
   ```

3. **Run the tests** - Don't assume tests prove anything without running them
   ```bash
   # Should have verified:
   pnpm env:juce-server  # Start test server
   pnpm test:slot-copy   # Run actual test
   ```

4. **Inspect actual bytes** - Log or capture the SysEx messages
   ```typescript
   // Should have added:
   console.log('Write message:', message.map(b => '0x' + b.toString(16)));
   ```

5. **Physical verification** - Check device display to see which slot changed
   - After write to "slot 7", check if device shows slot 7 or slot 0 changed
   - This is the ground truth

## Impact Assessment

### Direct Impact

- ❌ User received false confidence in broken feature
- ❌ Additional features built on false assumption (CLI command, backup slot arg)
- ❌ Documentation updated claiming incorrect behavior
- ❌ Test created that would have caught bug, but never run

### Indirect Impact

- ❌ Time wasted building features that depend on broken foundation
- ❌ Potential for bug to reach production if not caught
- ❌ Erosion of trust in AI-provided analysis

### Severity Factors

**Why This Was Critical**:
1. **High Confidence Assertion**: "✅ YES - We Have Proof It Works"
2. **Multiple Forms of "Proof"**: Test scripts, backup files, API methods
3. **Continued Building**: Added features without verifying foundation
4. **Documentation Updates**: Claimed protocol understanding was correct

## Corrective Actions

### Immediate (Today)

- [x] Acknowledge error to user
- [ ] Fix `buildCustomModeWriteRequest()` to use slot parameter
- [ ] Update `DeviceManager.writeCustomMode()` to pass slot
- [ ] Run `test-slot-copy.ts` to verify fix works
- [ ] Verify physical device behavior

### Short-Term (This Week)

- [ ] Add pre-commit test that verifies read/write symmetry
- [ ] Add integration test that verifies physical slot selection
- [ ] Document required verification steps for protocol claims
- [ ] Review all other protocol implementations for similar issues

### Long-Term (Ongoing)

- [ ] Never claim functionality works without execution proof
- [ ] Always read implementation code, not just signatures
- [ ] Always run tests before citing them as proof
- [ ] Always verify physical behavior for hardware interfaces
- [ ] Maintain healthy skepticism of untested code

## Lessons Learned

### For AI Agents

1. **Code Existence ≠ Code Correctness**
   - Finding a function doesn't prove it works
   - Read the implementation, don't trust the signature

2. **Test Existence ≠ Test Validation**
   - Test code is not proof of functionality
   - Tests must be executed and pass to prove anything

3. **Related Feature Working ≠ Target Feature Working**
   - Reading slots working doesn't prove writing slots works
   - Verify each code path independently

4. **API Surface ≠ Implementation Completeness**
   - Methods can accept parameters and ignore them
   - Check if parameters are actually used in implementation

5. **Never Claim Proof Without Verification**
   - "Proof" requires execution results, not code existence
   - Be explicit about what was and wasn't verified

### For Software Engineering

1. **Symmetry Checks Matter**
   - If read and write are inverse operations, their implementations should be symmetric
   - Asymmetry is a code smell

2. **Integration Tests Must Run**
   - Tests in the repo that aren't in CI are effectively not tests
   - Require test environment setup or skip verification

3. **Physical Verification for Hardware**
   - Software tests can pass while hardware behaves incorrectly
   - Always verify with actual device when possible

4. **Protocol vs Implementation**
   - Understanding the protocol doesn't mean code follows it
   - Verify implementation matches specification

## Verification Checklist (Going Forward)

Before claiming any feature works, verify:

- [ ] **Read the implementation** - Not just the signature
- [ ] **Execute the tests** - Don't assume they pass
- [ ] **Check symmetry** - Compare related operations
- [ ] **Inspect actual data** - Log or capture real messages
- [ ] **Physical verification** - Test with actual hardware if applicable
- [ ] **Negative testing** - Verify failure cases fail correctly

Before updating documentation:

- [ ] **Code matches spec** - Implementation follows protocol
- [ ] **Tests verify claim** - Specific tests prove specific claims
- [ ] **Evidence is current** - Based on latest code, not assumptions
