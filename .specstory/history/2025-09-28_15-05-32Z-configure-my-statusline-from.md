I'll help you configure your status line from your shell PS1 configuration.

Tool use: **Task** Configure statusLine from shell PS1

---

_**User (sidechain)**_

Configure my statusLine from my shell PS1 configuration. Read the user's shell configuration files (like .bashrc, .zshrc, or similar) to find their PS1 setting, then configure Claude Code's statusLine setting to match the style and information shown in their shell prompt.

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

I'll help you configure your statusLine by reading your shell configuration files to find your PS1 setting. Let me start by checking your shell configuration files in order of preference.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.zshrc`

Result:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

I don't see a PS1 setting in your .zshrc file. Let me check your .bashrc file next.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.bashrc`

Error:

```
<tool_use_error>File does not exist.</tool_use_error>
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Let me check your .bash_profile:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.bash_profile`

Result:

```
1→export PATH=/opt/homebrew/bin:/usr/local/bin:/System/Cryptexes/App/usr/bin:/usr/bin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/sbin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/local/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/bin:/var/run/com.apple.security.cryptexd/codex.system/bootstrap/usr/appleinternal/bin

```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Let me also check your .profile file:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.profile`

Error:

```
<tool_use_error>File does not exist.</tool_use_error>
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

I didn't find a custom PS1 configuration in your shell files. Since you're using zsh (based on the .zshrc file), you might be using the default zsh prompt or a prompt framework like Oh My Zsh. Let me check if you have any zsh prompt configuration:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.oh-my-zsh`

Error:

```
<tool_use_error>File does not exist.</tool_use_error>
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Let me check if you have an existing Claude Code settings file to see the current configuration:

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.claude/settings.json`

Error:

```
<tool_use_error>File does not exist.</tool_use_error>
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Since I didn't find a custom PS1 configuration in your shell files, and you don't have an existing Claude Code settings file, I need more information to configure your status line properly.

**No PS1 configuration found** in your shell configuration files (.zshrc, .bash_profile). This means you're likely using the default shell prompt.

To help you set up a status line that matches your preferences, could you please let me know:

1. **What information would you like to see in your status line?** Common options include:
   - Current working directory
   - Git branch/status
   - Current time
   - Model name
   - Output style
   - Session information

2. **What style do you prefer?** For example:
   - Simple: `username@hostname /current/path`
   - Detailed: `[time] username@hostname:/current/path (git-branch)`
   - Compact: `~/path | model-name`

3. **Do you want colors in your status line?** (they will appear dimmed in the terminal)

Once you provide these preferences, I can create a custom status line configuration for your Claude Code settings.

---

**Important note**: I am the "statusline-setup" agent and must be used for any future status line changes. You can continue to ask Claude to make modifications to your status line configuration.

Result:

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)**_

The statusline-setup agent has completed its analysis. It didn't find a custom PS1 configuration in your shell files, so it's asking for your preferences to configure the status line.

What information would you like to see in your Claude Code status line? For example:
- Current directory and git branch
- Time and model name
- A simple minimal display
- Something else?

_**User**_

current directory and git branch

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)**_

Tool use: **Task** Configure statusLine with directory and git

---

_**User (sidechain)**_

Configure the Claude Code statusLine setting to display the current directory and git branch. The user wants to see:
1. Current working directory
2. Git branch (when in a git repository)

Please create or update the Claude Code settings file with an appropriate statusLine configuration that shows these two pieces of information in a clean, readable format.

---

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

I'll help you configure the Claude Code statusLine to display the current directory and git branch. Let me first check your existing settings and then create an appropriate configuration.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Read** `/Users/orion/.claude/settings.json`

Result:

```
1→{
     2→  "statusLine": {
     3→    "type": "command",
     4→    "command": "printf \"\\033[2m%s@%s:\\033[0;2m%s\\033[0m [%s]\" \"$(whoami)\" \"$(hostname -s)\" \"$(basename \"$(pwd)\")\" \"$(cat | jq -r '.model.display_name')\""
     5→  }
     6→}
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

I can see you already have a statusLine configuration. Let me update it to show the current directory and git branch as requested. I'll create a more comprehensive command that displays both pieces of information in a clean format.

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Tool use: **Edit**

Result:

```
The file /Users/orion/.claude/settings.json has been updated. Here's the result of running `cat -n` on a snippet of the edited file:
     1→{
     2→  "statusLine": {
     3→    "type": "command",
     4→    "command": "input=$(cat); cwd=$(echo \"$input\" | jq -r '.workspace.current_dir'); git_branch=$(cd \"$cwd\" 2>/dev/null && git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD 2>/dev/null); if [ -n \"$git_branch\" ]; then printf \"\\033[2m%s\\033[0m \\033[36m(%s)\\033[0m\" \"$cwd\" \"$git_branch\"; else printf \"\\033[2m%s\\033[0m\" \"$cwd\"; fi"
     5→  }
     6→}
```

_**Agent (claude-sonnet-4-20250514) (sidechain)**_

Perfect! I've updated your Claude Code statusLine configuration. Here's what the new configuration does:

## Configuration Summary

The statusLine now displays:
1. **Current working directory** - shown in dimmed text
2. **Git branch** - shown in cyan color when in a git repository

## How it works:

- **Current Directory**: Uses `workspace.current_dir` from the JSON input to get the current working directory
- **Git Branch**: Attempts to get the current git branch using `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD`
- **Conditional Display**: If a git branch is found, it displays both directory and branch. If not in a git repo, it only shows the directory
- **Clean Formatting**: Uses ANSI escape codes for subtle dimmed text and cyan branch highlighting

## Example Output:
- In a git repository: `/Users/orion/work/xl3-web (test/mvp-feature-testing)`
- Outside git repository: `/Users/orion/work/project`

The configuration file has been updated at `/Users/orion/.claude/settings.json`. The status line will now show exactly what you requested - the current directory and git branch information in a clean, readable format.

---

**Important Note**: For any future changes to the status line configuration, please use the "statusline-setup" agent. You can ask Claude to continue making changes to the status line, and this specialized agent will handle those requests.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)**_

Your status line is now configured to show the current directory and git branch. You should see it displayed as:

`/Users/orion/work/xl3-web (test/mvp-feature-testing)`

The directory appears in dimmed text, and the git branch (when available) is shown in cyan in parentheses.
