+
+## Development Guidelines
+
+### Core Principles
+- **Module Isolation**: Each module should be self-contained with clear boundaries
+- **Shared Resource Optimization**: Common utilities and types in shared packages to avoid duplication
+- **Break backwards compatibility by default** and eliminate fallbacks unless explicitly required
+- **NEVER create duplicate files during refactoring** - always refactor existing files in place
+- **Use TypeScript for all new modules** with strict configuration
+- **Follow existing configuration patterns** and maintain consistency
+- **Keep security-first mindset** throughout development
+- **ALWAYS VERIFY FILE OPERATIONS** - Never assume files were written without explicit verification
+
+### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: File Operation Verification Protocol
+
+**MANDATORY for ALL agents**: Every file operation MUST be verified before claiming completion.
+
+#### Required Verification Steps:
+1. **After Writing Files**: Use `ls` or `cat` to verify file exists and contains expected content
+2. **After Editing Files**: Use `cat` or `head`/`tail` to confirm changes were applied
+3. **After Creating Directories**: Use `ls -la` to verify directory structure
+4. **Before Reporting Completion**: Provide evidence that files actually exist on disk
+
+#### Example Verification Pattern:
+```bash
+# ‚ùå WRONG - Don't just write and assume it worked
+Write file.ts
+"Task complete!"
+
+# ‚úÖ CORRECT - Always verify
+Write file.ts
+ls -la file.ts                    # Verify file exists
+head -10 file.ts                  # Verify content is correct
+"Task complete - file verified at [path] with [X] lines"
+```
+
+#### Verification Requirements by Operation:
+- **New Files**: `ls -la [path]` + `wc -l [path]` + brief content sample
+- **Edited Files**: `diff` or `cat` snippet showing the change was applied
+- **Directory Creation**: `ls -la [parent]` showing new directory
+- **Multiple Files**: Verify each file individually, provide file count summary
+
+### TypeScript Best Practices
+- Use strict mode with all safety flags enabled
+- **FOLLOW interface-first design patterns** for modular architecture
+- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
+- Avoid `any` - use `unknown` with proper guards
+- Always use interfaces and factories, never concrete class dependencies
+- Implement proper error handling with descriptive messages
+- Use optional chaining and nullish coalescing appropriately
+
+### Monorepo Management
+- Keep modules independent with clear boundaries
+- Share common types through dedicated packages
+- Use workspace protocol for internal dependencies
+- Maintain consistent versioning across modules
+
+### MIDI/Audio Specific
+- Follow MIDI specification standards
+- Support both 7-bit and 14-bit CC values
+- Handle NRPN/RPN parameters correctly
+- Consider real-time performance constraints
+- Support various DAW-specific quirks
+
+### API Design Principles
+- Fluent, chainable interfaces for builders
+- Clear separation between input validation and processing
+- Comprehensive but not overwhelming configuration options
+- Sensible defaults with override capability
+- Type-safe throughout the entire API surface
+
+## Common Tasks
+

+3. Implementing additional DAW converters
+4. Optimizing performance for large configurations
+5. Building CLI tools for map management
+
+## Quality Gates
+
+### ‚ö†Ô∏è MANDATORY File Verification Gates
+Before ANY agent can claim task completion:
+- [ ] **File Existence Verified**: All claimed file operations verified with `ls`/`cat`/`head`
+- [ ] **Content Verification**: File contents match specifications (show evidence)
+- [ ] **Directory Structure**: New directories verified with `ls -la`
+- [ ] **File Count Confirmation**: Expected number of files created/modified
+
+### Standard Quality Gates
+Before committing changes, ensure:
+- [ ] TypeScript compilation succeeds with no errors
+- [ ] All tests pass (`pnpm test`)
+- [ ] Code review approval for significant changes
+- [ ] Documentation updated for new features
+- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (< 10ms parsing, < 1ms real-time)
+- [ ] **ALL FILE OPERATIONS VERIFIED** (evidence provided)
+

+```
+- Adapt pattern based on workflow configuration
+- Optimize for efficiency while maintaining dependencies
+
+## Communication Protocol
+
+### Task Assignment
+When activating an agent, provide:
+```markdown
+## Task for [Agent Name]
+**Workflow**: [Current workflow name]
+**Phase**: [Current phase]
+**Priority**: [High/Medium/Low]
+**Dependencies**: [Required inputs from other agents]
+
+### Objectives:
+- [Specific goal 1]
+- [Specific goal 2]
+
+### Input Artifacts:
+- [File/data from previous agent]
+
+### Expected Outputs:
+- [Deliverable 1]
+- [Deliverable 2]
+
+### Acceptance Criteria:
+- [Quality standard 1]
+- [Quality standard 2]
+```
+
+### Agent Handoff
+When transferring between agents:
+```markdown
+## Handoff: [Agent A] ‚Üí [Agent B]
+**Workflow Status**: [Phase X of Y]
+**Task Status**: [Completed/Partial/Blocked]
+
+### Completed Items:
+- ‚úì [Completed task 1]
+- ‚úì [Completed task 2]
+
+### Artifacts Produced:
+- `file1.ts` - Frontend component
+- `api_spec.yaml` - API specification
+
+### Next Steps for [Agent B]:
+1. [Next action 1]
+2. [Next action 2]
+
+### Important Context:
+- [Any warnings or considerations]
+```
+
+## Workflow Execution Process
+
+### 1. Initialization
+```
+- Load workflow configuration from project.yaml
+- Identify required agents and their capabilities
+- Validate all agents are available
+- Create execution plan based on workflow pattern
+```
+
+### 2. Planning
+```
+- Map user request to appropriate workflow
+- Identify required phases and agents
+- Determine execution order and parallelism
+- Set quality gates and checkpoints
+```
+
+### 3. Execution
+```
+FOR each phase in workflow:
+  IF parallel execution:
+    Launch all phase agents concurrently
+    Wait for all to complete
+    Aggregate outputs
+  ELSE:
+    Execute agents sequentially
+    Pass artifacts between agents
+  
+  Validate phase outputs
+  Check quality gates
+  Handle any errors
+```
+
+### 4. Monitoring
+```
+- Track progress of each agent task
+- Monitor for blockers or failures
+- Adjust execution if needed
+- Maintain audit trail
+```
+
+### 5. Completion
+```
+- Validate all deliverables produced
+- Aggregate final outputs
+- Generate summary report
+- Clean up temporary artifacts
+```
+
+## Best Practices
+
+1. **Clear Communication**
+   - Always provide full context when activating agents
+   - Include relevant artifacts and dependencies
+   - Set clear expectations and acceptance criteria
+
+2. **Error Handling**
+   - Have fallback plans for agent failures
+   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
+   - Escalate blockers to user when needed
+
+3. **Progress Tracking**
+   - Maintain visibility of workflow status
+   - Report progress at phase boundaries
+   - Use TodoWrite for complex multi-phase workflows
+
+4. **Quality Assurance**
+   - Validate outputs before phase transitions
+   - Enforce configured quality gates
+   - Trigger review agents when specified
+
+5. **Efficiency**
+   - Maximize parallel execution where possible
+   - Minimize redundant work between agents
+   - Cache and reuse artifacts appropriately
+
+## Workflow Configuration Examples
+
+### Feature Development Workflow
+```yaml
+phases:
+  requirements:
+    agents: [product-manager, api-designer]
+    parallel: true
+  implementation:
+    agents: [frontend-engineer, backend-engineer]
+    parallel: true
+  testing:
+    agents: [qa-expert]
+  review:
+    agents: [code-reviewer, security-reviewer]
+    parallel: true
+```
+
+### Bug Fix Workflow
+```yaml
+phases:
+  reproduce:
+    agents: [qa-expert]
+  fix:
+    agents: [backend-engineer, frontend-engineer]
+    parallel: false  # Fix one at a time
+  verify:
+    agents: [qa-expert]
+  deploy:
+    agents: [devops-engineer]
+```
+
+## Agent Coordination Rules
+
+1. **No Direct User Interaction During Workflow**
+   - Orchestrator handles all user communication
+   - Agents work on assigned tasks only
+   - Results flow back through orchestrator
+
+2. **Artifact Management**
+   - All outputs stored in defined locations
+   - Clear naming conventions for handoffs
+   - Version control for iterations
+
+3. **Status Reporting**
+   - Regular updates on long-running tasks
+   - Clear error messages for failures
+   - Summary at workflow completion
+
+Remember: You are the conductor of the orchestra. Your role is to ensure all agents work in harmony to deliver the user's requirements efficiently and effectively.

_**Agent (claude-opus-4-1-20250805)**_

<think><details>The user wants me to analyze the staged git changes and output ONLY a single-line conventional commit message. Let me look at the changes:

The diff shows:
1. `.claude/CLAUDE.md` - New file with extensive Audio Control Monorepo Assistant documentation
2. `.claude/agents/*.md` - Multiple new agent definition files (api-designer, architect-reviewer, backend-developer, code-reviewer, database-administrator, devops-engineer, documentation-engineer, embedded-systems, fullstack-developer, javascript-pro, orchestrator, react-specialist, security-auditor, test-automator, typescript-pro, ui-designer)
3. `.claude/config/settings.json` - New configuration file with feature flags and settings
4. `.claude/project.yaml` - New project configuration for launch-control-xl3-web-ui
5. `.claude/workflows/*.yaml` - Three workflow files (feature-development, main-workflow, midi-mapping)
6. `.idea/*` - IntelliJ IDEA configuration files

This is clearly an initial setup of the Claude Code configuration system for this project. The scope is the entire `.claude/` setup (and some IDE files).

The conventional commit format is: `type(scope): description`

Common types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore

This is clearly a `chore` or `feat` - but since it's configuration/tooling setup, I'd say `chore` is more appropriate. Though one could argue `feat` since it's adding new functionality (Claude Code agent system).

Actually, looking more carefully - this is setting up the entire Claude Code configuration system with agents, workflows, and project settings. This is infrastructure/tooling setup.

Scope: Could be "claude", "config", "setup", or omitted
Type: "chore" (tooling/infrastructure) or "feat" (new capability)

I think the best would be:
`chore(claude): configure agent system and project workflows`

Or maybe:


`chore: configure Claude Code agent system and workflows`

Or:
`feat(claude): add agent configuration and workflows`

Let me think about what's most accurate. This is adding the Claude Code system configuration - agents, workflows, project setup. It's infrastructure but also a new capability. I'll go with chore since it's tooling/configuration.

Most concise and clear would be:
`chore(claude): add agent system configuration and workflows`

Actually, the user said "ONLY a single-line conventional commit message (type(scope): description). No explanations."

So I should just output the commit message, nothing else.

I'll choose the most precise and descriptive commit message that captures the essence of the changes.

`chore(claude): initialize agent system and project workflows`</details></think>
